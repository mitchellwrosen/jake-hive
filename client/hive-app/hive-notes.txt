hive project github repo:
https://github.com/mitchellwrosen/jake-hive
	
to run the localhost hive FAKE server:
	1. cd jake-hive/client/fake-server
	2. npm install (you only need to do this one time)
	3. node server (server will startup up on port 8080 and listen for messages)

to run the localhost hive client UI:
	1. cd jake-hive/client/hive-app
	2. npm install (you only need to do this one time)
	2. ng server
	3. http://localhost:4200

server board state example:
{
	"tag": "game_state_move",
	"contents": {
		"board" : { 
			"rows": 9,
			"cols": 11,
			"parity": false,
			"cells": [
				{"row" : 4, "col" : 2, "tiles" : [ {"bug" : "beetle", "color" : "white"} ]},
				{"row" : 4, "col" : 3, "tiles" : [ {"bug" : "ant",    "color" : "white"}, {"bug" : "spider", "color" : "black"} ]},
				{"row" : 5, "col" : 4, "tiles" : [ {"bug" : "queen",  "color" : "black"} ]}
			]

miscellaneous notes for dad	
====================================

to deploy to a non-root folder of the website:
	1. cd jake-hive/client/hive-app
	2. ng build --prod --base-href \"/hive/\"
	3. copy all files in the dist folder to <website_root>/hive
	4. done!

to pull down a github angular 2 websocket demo app, here is the best example:
(note: this was used to get websockets into the hive app above)
	https://www.dev6.com/Angular2-WebSockets
	https://github.com/DEV6hub/DEV6Blog/tree/master/angular2socketio

	note that the angular-cli.json file in the root of the demo needs this change:
	
	"scripts": [],
    "environmentSource": "environments/environment.ts",
    "environments": {
      "dev": "environments/environment.ts",
      "prod": "environments/environment.prod.ts"
    }
